## Project Description:

In this project, we completed a job simulation focused on Data Analytics and Commercial Insights as part of the Quantium Data Analytics Job Simulation. This Python-based project involved developing expertise in data preparation and customer analytics, where we utilized transaction datasets to extract valuable insights and deliver data-driven commercial recommendations. We extended our analytical capabilities by identifying benchmark stores for conducting uplift testing on trial store layouts, enabling evidence-based decision-making. Additionally, we leveraged the data analytics and insights acquired from previous tasks to create comprehensive reports for the Category Manager. These reports facilitated informed strategic decisions and enhanced commercial applications, demonstrating the practical utility of the analytics performed.
